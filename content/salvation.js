Our God is greater than all things, 
  He exalts the humble and the small,
  He brings the poor up from down low, 
  and brings the lost into the light

His Will is greater than that of people
  He has knowledge of all secrets and truths

Our God is a good God, for He shows both mercy and love
  He is also generous, whether that be in this life or the next

Indeed, He saves the one who calls out to Him
  He has power to turn the evil toward the light
For Our God is a good God, and many are saved in death

He has created the Next Life, the Earth, and all things Unseen,
  He has made some things enjoyable, even miracles
Yet His Presence is the Ultimate Reward, our greatest hope

___

May He grant godspeed to the one who is patient,
  May He grant glory to the one who seeks God's
May He grant riches to the one who seeks goodness,
  May He grant peace to the peaceful
May He grant happiness to the one who seeks others,
  Praise God in all His Might, nothing dictates against Him
